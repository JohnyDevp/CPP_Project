## DESCRIPTION
This program represents a tool for creating class diagrams and related sequence diagrams.
This implementation-supported mode consists of only one must-opened class diagram and several related sequence diagrams.
The application can either create a whole new project or load one from an existing file - the only supported format is JSON.


## TODOS

[ ] Do we need an interface? If so, then we need to call virtual destructors.
[ ] Readme must be .txt
